## Conventional Commits
Using Conventional Commits is simple. Simply preface your commit message with one of the following prefixes:
- feat: For new features.
- fix: For bug fixes.
- docs: Changes to documentation. Only use if the commit only changes documentation.
- style: Changes that do not effect the purpose of the project. (Formatting, adjusting for best-practices, etc.).
- refactor: A change to the core project that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature.
- perf: A change to improve performance.
- chore: Changes to the production process or auxiliary tools.

## Examples
This list will show some, but not all, use-cases for each of the conventional commit categories.
