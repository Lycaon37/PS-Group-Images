## About

This PowerShell script will consolidate images from a database of folders. While this script can be used with any image source, I had designed it because of problems I had with various screenshot systems for games. Steam, for instance, places screenshots in documents. NVIDIA Ansel places screenshots in videos. The Windows Game Bar places screenshots in pictures. With all these folders, it can be hard to keep track of what is stored where. This script can take all the pictures from those folders and organize them neatly! It will name according to a specified name followed by a four digit pattern. The images will be converted to JPGs and sorted into appropriately named folders. With a bit of work using the task scheduler in Windows, this could be set up to run automatically at preset times, such as every day at 8:00 AM, for example.

### Built With

- [PowerShell 7](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell) - Scripting Language
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - Script Writing
- [PowerShell Extension for Visual Studio Code](https://github.com/PowerShell/vscode-powershell) - Script Writing, Debugging
- [Affinity Photo](https://affinity.serif.com/en-us/photo/) - Media Creation

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A computer running Microsoft Windows.
- [PowerShell 7](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell) or Windows PowerShell 5.1. Windows PowerShell 5.1 should already be installed on your computer. That will work just fine, but the menu to add folders is nicer with PowerShell 7.
- The PowerShell module [PSMenu](https://github.com/Sebazzz/PSMenu). To install PSMenu, open PowerShell and use the following command:

```powershell
Install-Module PSMenu -Scope CurrentUser
```

### Installation

Download the latest release from the [Releases] section. Extract the provided .zip file into any folder you like.
Once the release is extracted, right-click on the file "New-Launcher.ps1" to generate shortcuts to launch the remaining scripts more easily. Once the shortcuts have been generated, it is ready to go!

**Note:** Please do not relocate the scripts after generating shortcuts. This will cause the shortcuts to break. To fix this, run "New-Launcher.ps1" again using the same method as before to regenerate the shortcuts.

## Usage

First, add folders to be organized. To do this, use the shortcut titled "Edit-Database". Then, follow the on-screen instructions in the newly-opened menu to add a folder to the folder list. When done, press escape or close the window to exit the editor. Once folders have been added, run the shortcut titled "Group-Images" to start the sorting process. It will then sort all the pictures found in the database.

### Alternative Method

Alternatively, you may manually edit the file "Database.csv". To edit this, any spreadsheet program can be used. I use [Microsoft Excel](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/excel), but other options include [Google Sheets](https://www.google.com/sheets/about/), [Libre Calc](https://www.libreoffice.org/), and even Notepad. Before editing the file, take care to not edit the first two lines, containing "#TYPE System.Management.Automation.PSCustomObject,,", and "Name,Path,Pattern". When editing the file, entries must follow the following pattern:

```Comma-Separated-Values
Name,FilePath,FileFilter
```

Where the Name is the name you want the files to follow, FilePath is the path to search for files, and FileFilter is a Regular Expression pattern used to search for files with. Examples include:
- \*Canyon\* - Search for all files containing the word "Canyon".
- \*Family Trip - Search for all files ending with the phrase "Family Trip".
- Yellowstone\* - Search for all files beginning with the word "Yellowstone".
- . (period) - A period all by itself in the FileFilter section includes all files instead of filtering.
